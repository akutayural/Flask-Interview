# Reporting API
First of all, I really appreciate for giving me a chance to be interviewed by you.

In the project, there are 5 endpoints that I can request. I couldn't use the 2nd endpoint which is Transaction Report because of the internal server problem of the 
endpoint. When I try to request with the parameters and a token, response as a JSON is shown below.

    {
    "code": 9,
    "status": "DECLINED",
    "message": "10.72.23.66:27017: The 'cursor' option is required, except for aggregate with the explain argument"
    }

I think the endpoint uses MongoDB(port 27017) and the error comes from the MongoDB!

- [:heavy_check_mark:] Develop a web application, consume at least 4 endpoints from given document
- [:heavy_check_mark:] Prepare unit tests (pytest, etc.)
- [:heavy_check_mark:] Use git for version control
- [:heavy_check_mark:] Use bitbucket, github or gitlab for hosting your project
- [:heavy_check_mark:] Use Python3 and Flask framework. 


- I have successfully consume the 4 endpoints. 

- Test Cases Succesfully passed. (In order to run the test, execute 'pytest' command in terminal)

- I have successfully host my website through the link below:

  https://akutayural.github.io/Flask-Interview/templates/

- I have successfully commit my project from VSCode with a main branch as I'm the only worker of the project and version control have been made and everthing is
up-to-date

- I strongly suggest you to download the project in your local computer and run it on localhost:5000 . GitHub Pages doesn't work properly sometimes.

# How To Improve The Project More and More?
- Session Control can be added.
- More test conditions can be added.
- Security issues must be taken into consideration more!



# Please Consider 
- Although I know Pure Python, Data Science and Machine Learning libraries(such as: numpy,pandas,scikit-learn) and I used Django before to develop a web app,
this is my first time developing a web app with flask. I have experience of these things given in the project with JAVA Spring. I'm a fast learner and I have passion for it. Although I work 32 hours in a restaurant and have 12 hours course
university in a week, I tried to finish the interview questions. I love coding so much!
